# A Blank template

I always bemone the fact that I dont have a blank template that I can clone when I'm starting a new project instead of having to copy/paste from previous work. So I made one.

I imagine this to grow as I learn + have time.

## Usage

1. `git clone git@github.com:rey/blank.git a-project`

## Bits

* A `.tm_properties` file to set my TextMate preferences
* Uses [Skeleton](https://github.com/dhgamache/Skeleton), a Beautiful Boilerplate for Responsive, Mobile-Friendly Development
* Compass + a config file thats useful to me
* Bunch of other gems (including [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll))
* A SASS file with a bunch of helper stuff which I find useful
* A bog standard HTML file

## To do

* Go home and eat
