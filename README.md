# A Blank template

I always bemone the fact that I dont have a blank template that I can clone when I'm starting a new project instead of having to copy/paste from previous work. So I made one.

I imagine this to grow as I learn + have time.

## Usage

1. `git clone git@github.com:rey/blank.git a-project`
2. `cd path/to/a-project`
3. `bundle install`
4. `compass watch`

## The good stuff lives in the `assets` folder

* `assets/stylesheets/sass/`
* `assets/stylesheets/sass/partials/`
* `assets/stylesheets/css/`
* `assets/stylesheets/css/skeleton/`
* `assets/images/`
* `assets/fonts/`
* `assets/js/`
